# Do Deep Learning Models Generalize to Overhead Imagery from Novel Geographic Locations? The XGD Benchmark Problem

## Dataset
We use two publicly available benchmark datasets in building segmentation of the overhead imagery: [Inria](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/) and [DeepGlibe](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/18544) in the XGD benchmark problem. However, thoretically, you can use any two datasets to form a XGD testing scenario as long as the two datasets share the same annotated classes and resolution.

## Setup


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/bohaohuang/xgd.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bohaohuang/xgd.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
